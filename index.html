		<h2><i class="fas fa-coffee"></i> Boring life stuff</h2>
		<p>
		I've been programming since the early age of about 10 with my first programming steps on a commodore 64/128 (<em>Commodore BASIC and 6502 assembler</em>) and a bit of <em>what I think was Fortran</em> on an earlier specialized computer connected to an automated weaving loom, in a now long gone company my mother worked for, that still needed to be loaded by using punched cards. (think it was a PDP-9)</p>
		<p>Later I moved on to Intel32 assembly (MASM32 format) on win32, and have dabbled in a lot of languages whatever took my fancy and in context of my needs: <em>PHP</em> and original <em>ASP</em> for webdev, c and assembly for general (CLI) programs, later on <em>Visual Basic 5/6</em> for GUI desktop programs.
		</p>
		<p>
		Worked for quite a few companies doing general tech support but also database back-end programming, like <em>3-COM USROBOTICS</em> during the time the dinosaurs still roamed the earth confident that the dial-up modem was all anyone would ever need. <em>Ericsson</em> before the SONY era, where I developped the first initial WAP pages and gave support for the first ever '<em>data products</em>' as we called it then, before the <em>new millenium</em>. And lots of other companies like various ISP and a webdev division of Confederatie Bouw.</p>
		<p>
		Got bored a bit and a bit miffed at the lack of career growth combined with the constant necessity of having the prove myself time and again at every occassion, something I wasn't great at to begin with back then and took a different route that led me to our nation's biggest provider of public transport: <em>SNCB</em>, where I've worked for nearly 15 years (lacking 2 weeks..) as a <em>Train Manager/Treinbegeleider/Accompagnateur de Train</em>. the novelty and shine of that has also worn off over time and I'm finding myself now again on a fork in the road that leads me to here: the opportunity offered to me be the kind guys of Switchfully, back to development.

		 I know I'm probably the last one to turn this assignment in: didn't have much time lately and have been recovering from (pretty painful) surgery to my mouth and jaw the last few weeks (my apologies should I be harder to understand in the coming period). Please don't equate it to my current motivation with regards to the coming course: I'm really looking forward to it and to meeting you all.
		</p>
		<h2><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> Current interests and occupations</h2>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>I'm generally interested in low-level programming: how CPUs actually work and do things. Also kernel programming, driver programming, langauge and compiler construction. Total noob at it but still find it interesting. I generally try to learn kernel programming in the BSD world on the DragonFlyBSD OS. </li>
			<li>Unix OSes have my strong preference over windows since I generally live in a shell and I have switched from linux to BSD quite a while ago.
	preferred editor: vim. (but I'm experimenting with spacemacs lately)</li>
			<li>Would like to learn about machine learning, since it seems like an interesting subject when combined with current IoT possibilities. Enjoy making tiny IoT/electronics stuff as well, currently working on a humidity sensor reporting project for my rental home since I've had a humidity issue earlier. A preliminary version of the supporting webservice (java Spring-boot based with a postgresql database backend) is finished already. Still have to finalize the code for the electronics (ESP8266 NODEMCU SOC with BME280 sensor), design and have PCBs made and design and 3D-print a good enclosure so that it fits in an IKEA Sp√∂ka.</li>
			<li>I'd enjoy learning more about the current legal requirements of the european software world like GDPR</li>
			<li>I'm also a casual gamer with a penchant for builder and survival oriented games.</li>
			<li><em>Cats</em>.</li>
			</ul>
